Spread 1 tablespoon butter on one side of each slice of bread. With butter side down, top each slice of bread with about Â½ cup cheddar. 

In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add two slices of bread, butter side down. Cook until bread is golden and cheese is starting to melt, about 2 minutes. Flip one piece of bread on top of the other and continue to cook until cheese is melty, about 30 seconds more.
